## Layout Before Animation

Position every element where it should be at its **most visible moment** — the frame where it's fully entered, correctly placed, and not yet exiting. Write this as static HTML+CSS first. No GSAP yet.

**Why this matters:** If you position elements at their animated start state (offscreen, scaled to 0, opacity 0) and tween them to where you think they should land, you're guessing the final layout. Overlaps are invisible until the video renders. By building the end state first, you can see and fix layout problems before adding any motion.

### The process

1. **Identify the hero frame** for each scene — the moment when the most elements are simultaneously visible. This is the layout you build.
2. **Write static CSS** for that frame. The `.scene-content` container MUST fill the full scene using `width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: Npx;` with `display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: Npx; box-sizing: border-box`. Use padding to push content inward — NEVER `position: absolute; top: Npx` on a content container. Absolute-positioned content containers overflow when content is taller than the remaining space. Reserve `position: absolute` for decoratives only.
3. **Add entrances with `gsap.from()`** — animate FROM offscreen/invisible TO the CSS position. The CSS position is the ground truth; the tween describes the journey to get there. (In sub-compositions loaded via `data-composition-src`, prefer `gsap.fromTo()` — see load-bearing GSAP rules in [references/motion-principles.md](./motion-principles.md).)
4. **Add exits with `gsap.to()`** — animate TO offscreen/invisible FROM the CSS position.

### Example

```css
/* scene-content fills the scene, padding positions content */
.scene-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 120px 160px;
  gap: 24px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
.title {
  font-size: 120px;
}
.subtitle {
  font-size: 42px;
}
/* Container fills any scene size (1920x1080, 1080x1920, etc).
   Padding positions content. Flex + gap handles spacing. */
```

**WRONG — hardcoded dimensions and absolute positioning:**

```css
.scene-content {
  position: absolute;
  top: 200px;
  left: 160px;
  width: 1920px;
  height: 1080px;
  display: flex; /* ... */
}
```

```js
// Step 3: Animate INTO those positions
tl.from(".title", { y: 60, opacity: 0, duration: 0.6, ease: "power3.out" }, 0);
tl.from(".subtitle", { y: 40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "power3.out" }, 0.2);
tl.from(".logo", { scale: 0.8, opacity: 0, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);

// Step 4: Animate OUT from those positions
tl.to(".title", { y: -40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.in" }, 3);
tl.to(".subtitle", { y: -30, opacity: 0, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.in" }, 3.1);
tl.to(".logo", { scale: 0.9, opacity: 0, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.in" }, 3.2);
```

### When elements share space across time

If element A exits before element B enters in the same area, both should have correct CSS positions for their respective hero frames. The timeline ordering guarantees they never visually coexist — but if you skip the layout step, you won't catch the case where they accidentally overlap due to a timing error.

### What counts as intentional overlap

Layered effects (glow behind text, shadow elements, background patterns) and z-stacked designs (card stacks, depth layers) are intentional. The layout step is about catching **unintentional** overlap — two headlines landing on top of each other, a stat covering a label, content bleeding off-frame.
